# Deep Learning

Everything about Machine Learning and Artificial intelligence.

This is a place where you will find all the things I study in regards to Machine Learning and Artificial intelligence.

Folder and what is in them:
1. Libraries: Basics of popular python library such as Matplotlib and Numpy.

2. Primitive Neuron: This is the backbone of machine learning and how it all started. It consists of 2 primitive machine learning algorithm MP Neuron and Perceptron.

3. Sigmoid Neuron: This is an improvement on the previous Primitive Neurons

4. Feed Forward Neural Network: Using the concepts of neural network with sigmoid as neurons to solve binary and multi class classifications.
